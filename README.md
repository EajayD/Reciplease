# Reciplease

A new kind of recipe book. In a world of online databases we created a user friendly personal cookbook. The user can upload family recipies or their personal favorites and share them with friends, family, and our Reciplease community. The next time you are at a bbq and taste someone's homemade mac n cheese asking, "Recipe, please!" is now as easy as a click of a button.
